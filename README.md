My Love Rosie Site
Welcome to my Love Rosie website in GitHub!

This website was built as part of the learning material for Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer program.

You can check out the website here.

Project Description
This site was created as a mobile first site to show the CV and career of Rosie Odenkirk. The site has three pages and a CV download to demonstrate navigation, text and image presentation and the use of forms. With responsiveness included to optimise use on different screen size devices.

Technology
This site was created using HTML, Boootstrap and CSS on Gitpod. It also includes favicon and Font Awesome icons and google fonts.

Testing
The site was tested live to check obvious links and responsiveness. The W3C HTML and CSS code checkers were usesd to check the code copied over from the live site (using Dev Tools in Chrome).
